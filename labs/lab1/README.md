# Lab 1: Currency Converter

## Usage

``` bash
npm install
npm start # for cli menu
npm test # for jasmine
```

## Instructions

Create a console application that prompts a user with a menu system for

- The initial or starting currency.
- The target or destination currency
- Prompt the user to indicate how much money they want to convert. The conversion will use the destination currency.
- Make a RESTful call to currencyapi.com and do the conversion.
- If any errors, capture the exception and report it using Toastr (don't think it's possible cli tool???? but I wasn't in lecture)
- Write at least 3 Jasmine tests on your functionality
